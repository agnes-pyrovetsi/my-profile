        <p>Let me tell you a bit about myself! I'm from Thessaloniki, Greece, which is the second largest city in the country. I was born and raised there, living in the suburbs with my family. I have one older brother who is currently studying in Chicago, three dogs and a  big number of cats. I speak four languages: Greek, English, French, and a bit of Italian, and I'm eager to learn many more. I'm very curious, always looking to discover and try out new things, adventurous, friendly, cheerful and positive. I'm excited to share more about myself with you!</p>

        <h2>My Passions and Interests</h2>
        <p>I have a wide range of passions that include architecture, F1 and racing cars, traveling, photography, and animals. Each of these has played a significant role in shaping who I am today, and I'm eager to dive deeper into each one.</p>

    <div id="architecture" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>My passion for architecture is deeply rooted in my admiration for my mother, an architect whose work has inspired me since I was a little kid. Her dedication and creativity sparked my interest and led me to pursue it further. I attended weekly architectural design and free-hand drawing courses for two years during high school, enhancing my skills and understanding. Additionally, I've participated in several summer programs and online courses focused on the principles of architecture and its history through time, broadening my knowledge and my enthusiasm for it.</p>

    <div id="racing" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>F1 and Racing Cars</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was little, I loved watching F1 races with my dad every Sunday. It was exciting and got me really into all the cool strategies and tech behind the races. Later, I got to dive even deeper into this world by joining the F1 in Schools competition. It was a chance to really get hands-on and learn how these fast cars work. Moving from just watching the races to actually being part of a racing competition made me love it even more.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="travelling" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life I have been very lucky to be given the chance to travel to many places around the world. I've explored a lot parts of Europe and been to over 10 countries. I have also travelled a lot around Greece and explored all the hidden gems and islands. I love travelling and exploring new places, whether it's with my family, friends or even alone. </p>

    <div id="photography" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>Taking pictures of the times I have with my friends and family means a lot to me. It's a way to keep those memories safe and share the fun stories behind them. My camera helps me see things in a special way, making even the small moments special. It's like having a magic tool that stops time, letting me go back to those good times whenever I want and share them with everyone. It's a simple way to make sure we never forget the fun and love we share.</p>

    <div id="animals" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Animals</h2>
        <p>Animals just make life better, don’t they? I’ve always been all about keeping them safe and making sure they’re happy. My family and I have a big heart for them - we’ve adopted 3 dogs and 30 cats! Playing with them, taking them out on a walk or simply spending time with them, it’s just the best part of my day.</p>
